### Overview
 Sometimes you need a lowpoly mesh from your level for testing purposes, tweaking level design and/or navigation, etc.
 This little script solves this problem by dumping your current baked Navigation Mesh into a proper Mesh GameObject in your Scene.
 Also, it prompts you to save the mesh as a 3D asset into your Project.
  
### Instructions
 1. Select your GameObjects and bake your preferred Navigation Mesh.
 2. Run the tool from the top menu bar.
 
### Future Upgrades
 - Adding PROBuilder to this project would let you extrude the baked mesh, effectively creating a proper (editable in PROBUILDER) low polygon level aka *"GrayBoxing"*
